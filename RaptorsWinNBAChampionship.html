		<div class="Content"><p class="Main">On June 13th, 2019, the Raptors won Game 6 of the NBA Finals and took the series 4-2. For Toronto, this is a huge step, their first NBA title. And for Kawhi, he was awarded as the Finals MVP. They faced their greatest opponent, the Golden State Warriors. The Warriors are an astounding team; they’ve won three of the past five championships. The team's roster includes multiple All-Stars and 2 League MVPs. Still, even against a spectacular roster, Toronto was able to pull off the victory in the sixth game of the series. Here’s how the game went.</p>
			<p class="Main">For the most part of the game, the score was close, but the Raptors were up. Kevin Durant was not playing as he tore his ACL in Game 5 and had undergone surgery. Klay Thompson played the majority of the game and contributed 30 points, but was injured during the third quarter. Thompson was diagnosed with a torn ACL and both Thompson and Durant will not play all next year. Stephen Curry also had a major contribution of 21 and Andre Iguodala had 22 points.</p>
			<p class="Main">During the last stretch of the third quarter, the Warriors had an outbreak and got their first lead the entire game. However, it wasn’t enough and at the end of the game, it just came down to the Raptors making their shots count. Pretty much the whole Raptors lineup was contributing double digits. Siakam, Lowry, Leonard, VanVleet, and Ibaka scored 26, 26, 22, 22, 15 points respectively. Lowry had a hot streak giving them a big early lead, and VanVleet hit some ridiculous clutch three-pointers to help close out the game.</p>
