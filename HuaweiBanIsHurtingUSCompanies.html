		<div class="Content"><p class="Main">On May 16, 2019, President Trump’s Administration placed restraints on the business American companies are allowed to do with Huawei, a technology company originating from China. The ban prevents American companies from using telecommunications equipment from “blacklisted” companies, like Huawei.</p>
			<p class="Main">This ban is affecting major companies drastically. One huge example is Broadcom, a chip-making technology company. Broadcom’s CEO, Hock Tan, believes this ban and the overall trade war between US and China is part of the reason their stocks fell 8% in early trading. Tan gives a statement: “With respect to semiconductors, it is clear that the US-China trade conflict including the Huawei export ban is creating economic and political uncertainty and reducing visibility for global customers.”</p>
			<p class="Main">However, Broadcom isn’t the only company that was majorly effected by the ban; there were many others, but most importantly, in the next few years Huawei is projected to miss their predicted sales by $30 billion. Although Huawei reportedly denies their products being a risk of national security, the government still fears that Beijing could use the equipment to spy on other nations.</p>
